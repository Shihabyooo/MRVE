# MRVE - Multi Raster Value Extractor


Simple code to extract values from a (large) set of geoTIFF rasters for a single (for now) point.

This code relies on GDAL libraries to load and read the geoTIFFS, the Visual Studio project is configured to look for headers, libs and dlls in C:/lib/GDAL
This code relies on C++17 filesystem features.
